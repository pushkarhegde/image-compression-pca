Compression and Reconstruction of Colour Image Using Principal Component Analysis PCA

# Introduction

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure used to reduce the number of features within a dataset. This is often useful if you have a lot of variables within your data that are correlated, or if you need to reduce the size of your dataset. Here, I use PCA to reduce the size of an image.
